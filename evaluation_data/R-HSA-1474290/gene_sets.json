    "summary": "Collagen is a family of at least 29 structural proteins derived from over 40 human genes (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004). It is the main component of connective tissue, and the most abundant protein in mammals making up about 25% to 35% of whole-body protein content. A defining feature of collagens is the formation of trimeric left-handed polyproline II-type helical collagenous regions. The packing within these regions is made possible by the presence of the smallest amino acid, glycine, at every third residue, resulting in a repeating motif Gly-X-Y where X is often proline (Pro) and Y often 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp). Gly-Pro-Hyp is the most common triplet in collagen (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Collagen peptide chains also have non-collagenous domains, with collagen subclasses having common chain structures. Collagen fibrils are mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin. Other forms of collagen are abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. In muscle tissue, collagen is a major component of the endomysium, constituting up to 6% of muscle mass. Gelatin, used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed.\n\nOn the basis of their fibre architecture in tissues, the genetically distinct collagens have been divided into subgroups. Group 1 collagens have uninterrupted triple-helical domains of about 300 nm, forming large extracellular fibrils. They are referred to as the fibril-forming collagens, consisting of collagens types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII.  Group 2 collagens are types IV and VII, which have extended triple helices (>350 nm) with imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequences. Group 3 are the short-chain collagens. These have two subgroups. Group 3A have continuous triple-helical domains (type VI, VIII and X). Group 3B have interrupted triple-helical domains, referred to as the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens, Shaw & Olsen 1991). FACITs include collagen IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII and XXVI plus the transmembrane collagens (XIII, XVII, XXIII and XXV) and the multiple triple helix domains and interruptions (Multiplexin) collagens XV and XVIII (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004).  The non-collagenous domains of collagens have regulatory functions; several are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagen peptides all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N- and C-propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The intact form is referred to as a collagen propeptide, not procollagen, which is used to refer to the trimeric triple-helical precursor of collagen before the propeptides are removed. The C-propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, directs chain association during assembly of the procollagen molecule from its three constituent alpha chains (Hulmes 2002).<br><br>Fibril forming collagens are the most familiar and best studied subgroup. Collagen fibres are aggregates or bundles of collagen fibrils, which are themselves polymers of tropocollagen complexes, each consisting of three polypeptide chains known as alpha chains. Tropocollagens are considered the subunit of larger collagen structures. They are approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter, with a left-handed triple-helical structure, which becomes twisted into a right-handed coiled-coil 'super helix' in the collagen fibril. Tropocollagens in the extracellular space polymerize spontaneously with regularly staggered ends (Hulmes 2002). In fibrillar collagens the molecules are staggered by about 67 nm, a unit known as D that changes depending upon the hydration state. Each D-period contains slightly more than four collagen molecules so that every D-period repeat of the microfibril has a region containing five molecules in cross-section, called the 'overlap', and a region containing only four molecules, called the 'gap'. The triple-helices are arranged in a hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal array in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions (Orgel et al. 2006). Collagen molecules cross-link covalently to each other via lysine and hydroxylysine side chains. These cross-links are unusual, occuring only in collagen and elastin, a related protein.<br><br>The macromolecular structures of collagen are diverse. Several group 3 collagens associate with larger collagen fibers, serving as molecular bridges which stabilize the organization of the extracellular matrix. Type IV collagen is arranged in an interlacing network within the dermal-epidermal junction and vascular basement membranes. Type VI collagen forms distinct microfibrils called beaded filaments. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibrils. Type VIII and X collagens form hexagonal networks. Type XVII collagen is a component of hemidesmosomes where it is complexed wtih alpha6Beta4 integrin, plectin, and laminin-332 (de Pereda et al. 2009). Type XXIX collagen has been recently reported to be a putative epidermal collagen with highest expression in suprabasal layers (Soderhall et al. 2007). Collagen fibrils/aggregates arranged in varying combinations and concentrations in different tissues provide specific tissue properties. In bone, collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array with 40 nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits, which probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of  crystals of the mineral component, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) with some phosphate. Collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, tissue construction in growth and repair, and is changed in development and disease (Sweeney et al. 2006, Twardowski et al. 2007). A single collagen fibril can be heterogeneous along its axis, with significantly different mechanical properties in the gap and overlap regions, correlating with the different molecular organizations in these regions (Minary-Jolandan & Yu 2009).",

    "summary": "Collagen trimers in triple-helical form, referred to as procollagen or collagen molecules, are exported from the ER and trafficked through the Golgi network before secretion into the extracellular space. For fibrillar collagens namely types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum 2011) secretion is concomitant with processing of the N and C terminal collagen propeptides. These processed molecules are known as tropocollagens, considered to be the units of higher order collagen structures. They form within the extracellular space via a process that can proceed spontaneously, but in the cellular environment is regulated by many collagen binding proteins such as the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices) family collagens and Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans (SLRPs). The architecture formed ultimately depends on the collagen subtype and the cellular conditions. Structures include the well-known fibrils and fibres formed by the major structural collagens type I and II plus several different types of supramolecular assembly (Bruckner 2010). The mechanical and physical properties of tissues depend on the spatial arrangement and composition of these collagen-containing structures (Kadler et al. 1996, Shoulders & Raines 2009, Birk & Bruckner 2011).<br><br> Fibrillar collagen structures are frequently heterotypic, composed of a major collagen type in association with smaller amounts of other types, e.g. type I collagen fibrils are associated with types III and V, while type II fibrils frequently contain types IX and XI (Wess 2005). Fibres composed exclusively of a single collagen type probably do not exist, as type I and II fibrils require collagens V and XI respectively as nucleators (Kadler et al. 2008, Wenstrup et al. 2011).  Much of the structural understanding of collagen fibrils has been obtained with fibril-forming collagens, particularly type I, but some central features are believed to apply to at least the other fibrillar collagen subtypes (Wess 2005). Fibril diameter and length varies considerably, depending on the tissue and collagen types (Fang et al. 2012). The reasons for this are poorly understood (Wess 2005).<br><br>Some tissues such as skin have fibres that are approximately the same diameter while others such as tendon or cartilage have a bimodal distribution of thick and thin fibrils. Mature type I collagen fibrils in tendon are up to 1 cm in length, with a diameter of approx. 500 nm. An individual fibrillar collagen triple helix is less than 1.5 nm in diameter and around 300 nm long; collagen molecules must assemble to give rise to the higher-order fibril structure, a process known as fibrillogenesis, prevented by the presence of C-terminal propeptides (Kadler et al. 1987). In electron micrographs, fibrils have a banded appearance, due to regular gaps where fewer collagen molecules overlap, which occur because the fibrils are aligned in a quarter-stagger arrangement (Hodge & Petruska 1963). Collagen microfibrils are believed to have a quasi-hexagonal unit cell, with tropocollagen arranged to form supertwisted, right-handed microfibrils that interdigitate with neighbouring microfibrils, leading to a spiral-like structure for the mature collagen fibril (Orgel et al. 2006, Holmes & Kadler 2006).<br><br>Neighbouring tropocollagen monomers interact with each other and are cross-linked covalently by lysyl oxidase (Orgel et al. 2000, Maki 2006). Mature collagen fibrils are stabilized by lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-links. Hydroxylysyl pyridinoline and lysyl pyridinoline cross-links form between (hydroxy) lysine and hydroxylysine residues in bone and cartilage (Eyre et al. 1984). Arginoline cross-links can form in cartilage (Eyre et al. 2010); mature bovine articular cartilage contains roughly equimolar amounts of arginoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline based on peptide yields. Mature collagen fibrils in skin are stabilized by the lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-link histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine (Yamauch et al. 1987). Due to the quarter-staggered arrangement of collagen molecules in a fibril, telopeptides most often interact with the triple helix of a neighbouring collagen molecule in the fibril, except for collagen molecules in register staggered by 4D from another collagen molecule. Fibril aggregation in vitro can be unipolar or bipolar, influenced by temperature and levels of C-proteinase, suggesting a role for the N- and C- propeptides in regulation of the aggregation process (Kadler et al. 1996). In vivo, collagen molecules at the fibril surface may retain their N-propeptides, suggesting that this may limit further accretion, or alternatively represents a transient stage in a model whereby fibrils grow in diameter through a cycle of deposition, cleavage and further deposition (Chapman 1989).<br><br>In vivo, fibrils are often composed from more than one type of collagen. Type III collagen is found associated with type I collagen in dermal fibrils, with the collagen III on the periphery, suggesting a regulatory role (Fleischmajer et al. 1990). Type V collagen associates with type I collagen fibrils, where it may limit fibril diameter (Birk et al. 1990, White et al. 1997). Type IX associates with the surface of narrow diameter collagen II fibrils in cartilage and the cornea (Wu et al. 1992, Eyre et al. 2004). Highly specific patterns of crosslinking sites suggest that collagen IX functions in interfibrillar networking (Wess 2005). Type XII and XIV collagens are localized near the surface of banded collagen I fibrils (Nishiyama et al. 1994). Certain fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs) associate with the surface of collagen fibrils, where they may serve to limit fibril fusion and thereby regulate fibril diameter (Gordon & Hahn 2010). Collagen XV, a member of the multiplexin family, is almost exclusively associated with the fibrillar collagen network, in very close proximity to the basement membrane. In human tissues collagen XV is seen linking banded collagen fibers subjacent to the basement membrane (Amenta et al. 2005). Type XIV collagen, SLRPs and discoidin domain receptors also regulate fibrillogenesis (Ansorge et al. 2009, Kalamajski et al. 2010, Flynn et al. 2010).<br><br>Collagen IX is cross-linked to the surface of collagen type II fibrils (Eyre et al. 1987). Type XII and XIV collagens are found in association with type I (Walchli et al. 1994) and type II (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002) fibrils in cartilage. They are thought to associate non-covalently via their COL1/NC1 domains (Watt et al. 1992, Eyre 2002).  <br><br>Some non-fibrillar collagens form supramolecular assemblies that are distinct from typical fibrils. Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils, composed of antiparallel dimers that connect the dermis to the epidermis (Bruckner-Tuderman 2009). During fibrillogenesis, the nascent type VII procollagen molecules dimerize in an antiparallel manner. The C-propeptides are then removed by Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (Rattenholl et al. 2002) and the processed antiparallel dimers aggregate laterally. Collagens VIII and X form hexagonal networks and collagen VI forms beaded filament (Gordon & Hahn 2010, Ricard-Blum et al. 2011).",

    "summary": "After removal of the N- and C-procollagen propeptides, fibrillar collagen molecules aggregate into microfibrillar arrays, stabilized by covalent intermolecular cross-links. These depend on the oxidative deamination of specific lysine or hydroxylysine residues in the telopeptide region by lysyl oxidase (LOX) with the subsequent spontaneous formation of covalent intermolecular cross-links (Pinnell & Martin 1968, Siegel et al. 1970, 1974, Maki 2009, Nishioka et al. 2012). Hydroxylysine is formed intracellularly by lysine hydroxylases (LH). There are different forms of LH responsible for hydroxylation of helical and telopeptide lysines (Royce & Barnes 1985, Knott et al.1997, Takaluoma et al. 2007, Myllyla 2007). The chemistry of the cross-links formed depends on whether lysines or hydroxylysines are present in the telopeptides (Barnes et al. 1974), which depends on the proportion of collagen lysines post-translationally converted to hydroxylysine by LH. The lysine pathway predominates in adult skin, cornea and sclera while the hydroxylysine pathway occurs primarily in bone, cartilage, ligament, tendons, embryonic skin and most connective tissues (Eyre 1987, Eyre & Wu 2005, Eyre et al. 2008). Oxidative deamination of lysine or hydroxylysine residues by LOX generates the allysine and hydroxyallysine aldehydes respectively. These can spontaneously react with either another aldehyde to form an aldol condensation product (intramolecular cross-link), or with an unmodified lysine or hydroxylysine residue to form intermolecular cross-links.<br><br>The pathway of cross-linking is regulated primarily by the hydroxylation pattern of telopeptide and triple-helix domain lysine residues. When lysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the allysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of aldimine cross-links (Eyre & Wu 2005). These are stable at physiological conditions but readily cleaved at acid pH or elevated temperature. When hydroxylysine residues are the source of aldehydes formed by lysyl oxidase the hydroxyallysine cross-linking pathway leads to the formation of more stable ketoimine cross-links. <br><br>Telopeptide lysine residues can be converted by LOX to allysine, which can react with a helical hydroxylysine residue forming the lysine aldehyde aldimine cross-link dehydro hydroxylysino norleucine (deHHLNL) (Bailey & Peach 1968, Eyre et al. 2008). If the telopeptide residue is hydroxylysine, the hydroxyallysine formed by LOX can react with a helical hydroxylysine forming the Schiff base, which spontaneously undergoes an Amadori rearrangement resulting in the ketoimine cross link hydroxylysino 5 ketonorleucine (HLKNL). This stable cross-link is formed in tissues where telopeptide residues are predominanly hydroxylated, such as foetal bone and cartilage, accounting for the relative insolubility of collagen from these tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). In bone, telopeptide hydroxyallysines can react with the epsilon-amino group of a helical lysine (Robins & Bailey 1975). The resulting Schiff base undergoes Amadori rearrangement to form lysino-hydroxynorleucine (LHNL). An alternative mechanism of maturation of ketoimine cross-links has been reported in cartilage leading to the formation of arginoline (Eyre et al. 2010). <br><br>These divalent crosslinks greatly diminish as connective tissues mature, due to further spontaneous reactions (Bailey & Shimokomaki 1971, Robins & Bailey 1973) with neighbouring peptides that result in tri- and tetrafunctional cross-links. In mature tissues collagen cross-links are predominantly trivalent. The most common are pyridinoline or 3-hydroxypyridinium cross-links, namely hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HL-Pyr) and  lysyl-pyridinoline (L-Pyr) cross-links (Eyre 1987, Ogawa et al. 1982, Fujimoto et al. 1978). HL-Pyr is formed from three hydroxylysine residues, HLKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine. It predominates in highly hydroxylated collagens such as type II collagen in cartilage. L-Pyr is formed from two hydroxylysines and a lysine, LKNL plus a further hydroxyallysine, found mostly in calcified tissues (Bailey et al. 1998). Trivalent collagen cross-links can also form as pyrroles, either Lysyl-Pyrrole (L-Pyrrole) or hydroxylysyl-pyrrole (HL-Pyrrole), respectively formed when LKNL or HLKNL react with allysine (Scott et al. 1981, Kuypers et al. 1992). A further three-way crosslink can form when DeH-HLNL reacts with histidine to form histidino-hydroxylysinonorleucine (HHL), found in skin and cornea (Yamauchi et al. 1987, 1996). This can react with an additional lysine to form the tetrafunctional cross-link histidinohydroxymerodesmosine (Reiser et al. 1992, Yamauchi et al. 1996). <br> <br>Another mechanism which could be involved in the cross-linking of collagen IV networks is the sulfilimine bond (Vanacore et al. 2009), catalyzed by peroxidasin, an enzyme found in basement membrane (Bhave 2012).<br><br>To improve clarity inter-chain cross-linking is represented here for Collagen type I only. Although the formation of each type of cross-link is represented here as an independent event, the partial and random nature of lysine hydroxylation and subsequent lysyl oxidation means that any combination of these cross-linking events could occur within the same collagen fibril .",

    "summary": "Collagen fibrils are the principal tensile element of the extracellular matrix in a wide range of animal connective tissues. They have a 67 nm axial periodicity in most tissues, 65 nm in vertebrate skin, and are near-circular in transverse section. Fibril diameter depends both on tissue type and stage of development, covering a range of 20-500 nm in vertebrates. Fibril length is less well characterised but fibrils with lengths in the range 1-100 micrometres have been isolated.<br><br>Fibril formation is spontaneous (Fallas et al. 2010, Birk & Br\u00fcckner 2011), but influenced by developmental state and the cellular environment. Several models have been proposed including the simple surface nucleation and propagation (SNAP) model (Trotter et al. 2000) but the mechanism of fibril assembly and regulation of fibril diameter and length are not completely understood (Holmes et al. 2001, Banos et al. 2008). Fibrils frequently contain more than one type of collagen, and the outer surface of fibrils frequently interacts with proteoglycans, fine-tuning its structural and signaling properties (Wess 2005, Kalamajski & Oldberg 2010, Ricard-Blum et al. 2011).<br><br>Individual fibril-forming collagen molecules are around 300nm in length. Complete fibrils exhibit a 67 nm periodicity, seen with many different imaging methods. This is due to a staggered overlap of molecules which leads to regions where fewer molecules overlap with a periodicity of 67 nm (Hodge & Petruska 1963, Wess 2005). Laterally, molecules are believed to be packed into a quasi-hexagonal structure (Trus & Piez 1980) resulting in locally ordered crystalline regions interspersed with disordered regions across the lateral plane of the fibril (Hulmes 2002). Interactions between molecules stabilize the fibril, including the formation of divalent and subsequently trivalent crosslinks, unique to collagen, that involve lysine or hydroxylysine residues.",

    "summary": "Collagens IV, VI, VIII and X form open networks. Type IV networks are irregular. Type VIII and X form hexagonal networks. Type VI collagen forms tetramers which aggregate linearly to form beaded filaments, but also associates laterally through the globular domains so forming a network (Baldock et al. 2003, Knupp et al. 2006, ). Type IV collagen is the predominant collagen type in basement membranes (Parkin et al. 2011). It assembles into three distinct networks with differing combinations of alpha chains, namely alpha1.alpha1.alpha2, alpha3.alpha4.alpha5 and alpha1.alpha2.alpha5.alpha6, (Siebold et al. 1988, Gunwar et al. 1998, Borza et al. 2001), the last of these forms through the association of alpha5.alpha5.alpha6 triple-helical protomers and alpha1.alpha1.alpha2 protomers, interacting tail-to-tail at the retained NC1 domains. Further associations are formed by tetramerization of the 7S domain at the N terminus (Timpl et al. 1981, Siebold et al. 1987). These interactions are the most significant for network formation, but a third interaction occurs whereby type IV collagen dimers interact through lateral association (Yurchenco & Furthmayr 1984, Yurchenco & Ruben 1987, Yurchenko & Patton 2009). Collagen type VI forms tetramers and subsequently several types of higher-order structure (Ball et al. 2001, Beecher et al. 2011) that are probably influenced by the association of other matrix constituents such as hyaluronan (Kielty et al. 1992), fibrillin (Ueda & Yue 2003), biglycan and decorin (Wiberg et al. 2001). <br><br>Type VIII collagen forms a hexagonal lattice in Descemet's membrane (Shuttleworth 1997). These are thought to be derived from tetrahedral structures that form when 4 type VIII molecules associate via hydrophobic patches on their C-termini, which then associate via their N-terminals (Stephan et al. 2004). Type X collagen is very similar to type VIII and in vitro forms hexagonal arrays, believed to arise from interactions of the globular domains (Kwan et al. 1991, Jacenko et al. 2001). In vivo type X collagen is found associated with cartilage fibrils in the form of fine filaments (Schmidt & Linsenmayer 1990), which may represent hexagonal lattices that have collapsed during sample preparation (Gordon & Hahn 2010).",

    "summary": "Type XVII collagen is a component of hemidesmosomes (HDs) (Has & Kern 2010). It associates with integrin alpha6beta4 (a6b4) (Hopkinson et al. 1999). The extracellular region of a6b4 extends from the cell membrane into the basement membrane to bind laminins, with a preference for laminin-332 (Hopkinson & Jones 2000, Sugawara et al. 2008), which is a component of anchoring fibrils. Laminins are complex glycoproteins, consisting of alpha, beta and gamma chains bound into a cross-shaped molecule. Laminin-332 is a complex of alpha-3, beta-2 and gamma-2 subunits. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin beta-4 interacts with other hemidesmosomal components, plectrin and BPAG1. The interaction of a6b4 and plectrin is likely to be the initial step in HD formation (de Pereda et al. 2009). The cytoplasmic domain of collagen type XVII (BP180) binds to integrin beta-4, plectin and BPAG1 (Hopkinson & Jones 2000, Koster et al. 2003). The transmembrane protein CD151 (tetraspanin-24) associates with a6b4 (Sterk et al. 2002) and is essential for the correct assembly of basement membranes in human kidney and skin, possibly having a role in integrin alpha-3 maturation and cell surface expression (Karamatic Crew et al. 2003).",

    "summary": "The biosynthesis of collagen is a multistep process. Collagen propeptides are cotranslationally translocated into the ER lumen. Propeptides undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues may be hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this and of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1972, 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation. Collagen peptides all have non-collagenous domains; collagens within the subclasses have common chain structures. These non-collagenous domains have regulatory functions; some are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagens all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N and C propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The C propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, is highly conserved. It directs chain association during intracellular assembly of the procollagen molecule from three collagen propeptide alpha chains (Hulmes 2002). The N-propeptide has a short linker (NC2) connecting the main triple helix to a short minor one (COL2) and a globular N-terminal region NC3. NC3 domains are variable both in size and the domains they contain.<br><br>Collagen propeptides typically undergo a number of post-translational modifications. Proline and lysine residues are hydroxylated by prolyl 3-, prolyl 4- and lysyl hydroxylases. 4-hydroxyproline is essential for intramolecular hydrogen bonding and stability of the triple helical collagenous domain. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase may also have a role in alpha chain association as no association of the C-propeptides of type XII collagen was seen in the presence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (Mazzorana et al. 1993, 1996). In fibril forming collagens approximately 50% of prolines are 4-hydroxylated; the extent of this is species dependent, lower hydroxylation correlating with lower ambient temperature and thermal stability (Cohen-Solal et al. 1986, Notbohm et al. 1992). Similarly the extent of 3-hydroxyproline and lysine hydroxylation varies between tissues and collagen types (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Hydroxylysine molecules can form cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils, and are sites for glycosyl- and galactosylation.<br><br>Collagen molecules fold and assemble through a series of distinct intermediates (Bulleid 1996). Individual collagen polypeptide chains are translocated co-translationally across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intra-chain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (Kivirikko et al. 1992). When the peptide chain is fully translocated into the ER lumen the C-propeptide folds, the conformation being stabilized by intra-chain disulfide bonds (Doege and Fessler 1986). Pro alpha-chains associate via the C-propeptides (Byers et al. 1975, Bachinger et al. 1978), or NC2 domains for FACIT family collagens (Boudko et al. 2008) to form an initial trimer which can be stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds (Schofield et al. 1974, Olsen et al. 1976), though these are not a prerequisite for further folding (Bulleid et al. 1996). The triple helix then nucleates and folds in a C- to N- direction. The association of the individual chains and subsequent triple helix formation are distinct steps (Bachinger et al. 1980). The N-propeptides associate and in some cases form inter-chain disulfide bonds (Bruckner et al., 1978). Procollagen is released via carriers into the exracellular space (Canty & Kadler 2005). Fibrillar procollagens undergo removal of the C- and N-propeptides by procollagen C and N proteinases respectively, both Zn2+ dependent metalloproteinases. Propeptide processing is a required step for normal collagen I and III fibril formation, but collagens can retain some or all of their non-collagenous propeptides. Retained collagen type V and XI N-propeptides contribute to the control of fibril growth by sterically limiting lateral molecule addition (Fichard et al. 1995). Processed fibrillar procollagen is termed tropocollagen, which is considered to be the unit of higher order fibrils and fibres. Tropocollagens of the fibril forming collagens I, II, III, V and XI sponteneously aggregate in vitro in a manner that has been compared with crystallization, commencing with a nucleation event followed by subsequent organized aggregation (Silver et al. 1992, Prockop & Fertala 1998). Fibril formation is stabilized by lysyl oxidase catalyzed crosslinks between adjacent molecules (Siegel &  Fu 1976).",

    "summary": "Hydroxylysine glycosides are only found in collagen. Glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, before triple-helix formation. Either galactose or glucose-galactose are attached to approximately one third of hydroxylysine residues by specific transferases, beta(1-O)galactosyl- and alpha(1-2)glucosyltransferase, forming galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl) and glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Glu-Gal-Hyl) respectively. The genes COLGALT1 and COLGALT2  encode galactosyltransferases that are active with various types of collagen and the serum mannose-binding lectin MBL, which also contains a collagen domain. COLGALT1 is constitutively expressed in human tissues, whereas the COLGALT2 was found to be expressed only at low levels in the nervous system. These galactosyltransferases convert 5-hydroxylysine to 5-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl). The extent of hydroxylysine galactosylation is variable between collagen types and locations; it is particularly common in bone type I collagen (Al-Dehaimi et al. 1999). Although the fraction of hydroxylysine residues that are glycosylated does not differ between skin and bone (the major sources of type I collagen) the pattern of hydroxylysine glycosylation is different. Glu-Gal-Hyl predominates in skin, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is approximately 2 (Pinnell et al. 1971), whereas Gal-Hyl predominates in bone, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is 0.47 (Krane et al. 1977).",

    "summary": "Hydroxylysine glycosides are specific to collagen. Collagen glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum before triple-helix formation. Either galactose or glucose-galactose are attached to approximately one third of hydroxylysine residues by specific transferases, beta(1-O)galactosyl- and alpha(1-2)glucosyltransferase, forming galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl) and glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Glu-Gal-Hyl) respectively. The genes COLGALT1 and COLGALT2  encode galactosyltransferases that are active with various types of collagen and the serum mannose-binding lectin MBL, which also contains a collagen domain. COLGALT1 is constitutively expressed in human tissues, whereas the COLGALT2 was found to be expressed only at low levels in the nervous system. These galactosyltransferases convert 5-hydroxylysine to 5-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl). The extent of hydroxylysine galactosylation is variable between collagen types and locations; it is particularly common in bone type I collagen (Al-Dehaimi et al. 1999). Although the fraction of hydroxylysine residues that are glycosylated does not differ between skin and bone (the major sources of type I collagen) the pattern of hydroxylysine glycosylation is different. Glu-Gal-Hyl predominates in skin, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is approximately 2 (Pinnell et al. 1971), whereas Gal-Hyl predominates in bone, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is 0.47 (Krane et al. 1977).",

    "summary": "Collagen contains (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline (3-Hyp), though much less abundantly than 4-Hyp (Rhodes and Miller 1978). The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009). P3H2 hydroxylates peptides derived from Type IV collagen more efficiently than Type I peptides and is localized to tissues that are rich in basement membrane (Tiainen et al. 2008). The effect of prolyl 3-hydroxylation on basement membrane collagens remains unknown.<br><br> In this generalized reaction, all collagen subtypes are represented as having one 3-Hyp residue. ",

The monomers associate in antiparallel with a 30nm axial shift, intertwining 4 or 5 times (Furthmayr et al. 1983). These associate laterally to form tetramers (Furthmayr et al. 1983, von der Mark et al. 1984)The tetramers associate to form microfibrils in a non-covalent manner, presumed to be mediated through A domain interactions (Baldock et al. 2003). Collagen type VI chains are extensively post translationally modifed by the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004) and subsequent glycosylation of hydroxylysine, thought to be essential for tetramer formation and secretion (Sipila et al. 2007).",

    "summary": "Hydroxylysine glycosides are specific to collagen. Collagen glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum before triple-helix formation. Either galactose or glucose-galactose are attached to approximately one third of hydroxylysine residues by specific transferases, beta(1-O)galactosyl- and alpha(1-2)glucosyltransferase, forming galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl) and glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Glu-Gal-Hyl) respectively. The genes GLT25D1 and GLT25D2 encode galactosyltransferases that are active with various types of collagen and the serum mannose-binding lectin MBL, which also contains a collagen domain. GLT25D1 gene is constitutively expressed in human tissues, whereas the GLT25D2 gene was found to be expressed only at low levels in the nervous system. These galactosyltransferases convert 5-hydroxylysine to 5-galactosyl hydroxylysine (Gal-Hyl). The extent of hydroxylysine galactosylation is variable between collagen types and locations; it is particularly common in bone type I collagen (Al-Dehaimi et al. 1999). Although the fraction of hydroxylysine residues that are glycosylated does not differ between skin and bone (the major sources of type I collagen) the pattern of hydroxylysine glycosylation is different. Glu-Gal-Hyl predominates in skin, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is approximately 2 (Pinnell et al. 1971), whereas Gal-Hyl predominates in bone, where the Glu-Gal-Hyl/Gal-Hyl ratio is 0.47 (Krane et al. 1977).",

    "summary": "Collagen contains (2S,3S)-3-hydroxyproline (3-Hyp), though much less abundantly than 4-Hyp (Rhodes and Miller 1978). The 3-Hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-Hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states (Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is more prevalent in type IV and V collagens at 10-15 3-Hyp residues (Bentz et al. 1983) than in Type I-III fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-Hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type I collagen has 3-Hyp at residue 986 (Fietzek et al. 1972, Marini et al. 2007). 3-Hyp is formed from Pro in the Xaa position of Xaa-Hyp-Gly triplets (Gryder et al. 1975, Kivirikko et al. 1992). It is likely that 4-Hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-Hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-Hyp poor (Adams & Frank 1980). 3-Hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability (Jenkins et al. 2003; Mizuno et al. 2008). 3-Hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. It is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures (Weis et al. 2010). <br>3-Hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (P3H; EC 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. All contain an ER-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression (Vranka et al. 2009). P3H can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-Hyp residues (Tryggvason et al. 1976) but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline (Kivirikko & Myllla 1982, Myllyharju 2005). Like P4H, P3H requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(II), and ascorbate for activity. P3H1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (Gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin B (CypB), which is encoded by the PPIB gene (Vranka et al. 2004). Lack of 3-Hyp in Type I and II collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)-like disease, as demonstrated by CRTAP and PPIB knock-out mice (Morello et al. 2006, Choi et al. 2009) and by mutations in human LEPRE1 (which encodes P3H1), CRTAP, and PPIB (Barnes et al. 2006, Cabral et al. 2007, van Dijk et al. 2009). The P3H1/CRTAP/CypB complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity (Ishikawa et al. 2009). P3H2 hydroxylates peptides derived from Type IV collagen more efficiently than Type I peptides and is localized to tissues that are rich in basement membrane (Tiainen et al. 2008). The effect of prolyl 3-hydroxylation on basement membrane collagens remains unknown.",

    "summary": "As the collagen peptide chain is translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, intrachain disulfide bonds are formed within the N- and C-propeptides. This allows the triple helical domain to form a nucleation point at its C-terminal end and ensures correct alignment of the chains (Engel & Prockop 1991). Protein disulfide isomerase (P4HB) catalyzes the formation of both intra- (Bulleid & Freedman 1988) and inter-chain disulfide bonds (Koivu & Myllyl\u00e4 1987). In addition, PDI acts as a molecular chaperone, interacting with monomeric collagen propeptide chains to prevent premature assembly or aggregation (Wilson et al. 1998). ",

    "summary": "Lysyl hydroxylase (LH) (E.C. 1.14.11.4) is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the formation of (2S,5R)-5-hydroxylysyl residues (5-Hyl) in proteins (reviewed in Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2001) within a peptide linkage at the Y position of the repeating X-Y-Gly sequence motif. The extent of 5-Hyl formation is much more variable than that of hydroxyproline. It varies between collagen types, tissues and by physiological state (Miller 1984). 5-Hyl content also differs between the helical and telopeptide domains. This and the observation that purified lysyl hydroxylase failed to hydroxylate Lys in the telopeptide domains has led to speculation that there are separate enzymes responsible for Lys hydroxylation in the helical and telopeptide domains (Royce & Barnes 1985, Gerriets et al. 1993). The LH2b isoform may be the telopeptide-specific form (Pornprasertsuk et al. 2004).<br>In human type I collagen, there are 38 residues of Lys in each alpha-1 chain (36 in the helical domain, 1 each in the C- and N-telopeptide domains) and 31 in each alpha-2 chain (30 in the helical domain,1 in the N-telopeptide and none in the C-telopeptide domains) (Yamauchi & Shiiba 2002).  <br><br>LH requires ferrous iron, oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate. The hydroxylation reaction occurs during collagen biosynthesis in the ER as a co- and post-translational event, before triple helix formation. Three LH isoforms have been characterized in humans, encoded by the genes PLOD1-3. The isoforms appear to have preferences for certain collagen types, e.g. LH3 preferentially binds collagen types IV, VI, XI and XII (Myllyla et al. 2007). LH3 has galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase activities in addition to its lysyl hydroxylase activity (Heikkinen et al. 2000, Wang et al. 2002), a multifunctionality also seen in the single C. elegans orthologue (Wang et al. 2002a, b). Hydroxylysine residues can form stable intermolecular cross-links between collagen molecules in fibrils and also represent sites for glucosyl- and galactosyl- carbohydrate attachment. <br><br>In this reaction all collagen subtypes are represented as having a single hydroxylysine.",

    "summary": "Alignment of the C-terminal prodomains initiates triple helix formation, which propagates in a zipper-like fashion in the C-to-N direction. This occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (B\u00e4chinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (B\u00e4chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions  (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to  be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril. Sequences poor in imino acids will have a symmetry close to 10 tripeptide units for every 3 turns of the triple helix (10/3), while stretches of Gly-Pro-Hyp units may have 7/2 symmetry (Brodsky & Persikov 2005).",

    "summary": "Collagen was for many years considered the only source of 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) in animals. Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973,  Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H).  Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H.",

    "summary": "Fibrillar collagen is synthesized in the ER as procollagen with N- and C-terminal propeptides flanking the collagenous domain (Bellamy & Bornstein 1971). These propeptides, particularly the C-propeptide, inhibit fibril formation (Kadler et al. 1987). Type V collagen N-propeptide removal is partial, and reported to be mediated by BMP-1 which cleaves between the proline/arginine-rich protein domain and the variable domain of the alpha1 chain and between the small and the large collagenous domain of alpha3 chain (refs. in Colige et al. 2005). \n\n\nMutations in procollagen peptide type V (COL5A1) can cause diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos Sydrome. Majority of the cases result from haploinsufficiency of COL5A1 protein that may lead to a disorganised extracellular matrix. Moreover, other mutations result in structural defects which may in turn result in defective collagen fibrils. The accumulation and interaction of this defective collagen fibrils may lead to ER stress and other complications in the cell (Takahara K et al. 2002, Symoens S et al. 2012). ",

    "summary": "Collagen precursors are co-translated into the ER, where post-translational modifications occur that are essential for oligomerization and stabilization, the latter thought to involve Serpin H1 (HSP47). Trimers are exported from the ER and trafficked through the Golgi network before secretion into the extracellular space and organization into higher order structures. The precise route and mechanism of secretion for collagen is unclear (Canty & Kadler 2005). In the conventional protein secretion pathway cargo is collected at ER exits sites and loaded into small membrane vesicles that are generated by a set of highly conserved proteins called the coat protein complex II (COPII) (Jensen & Schekman 2011). However, these small vesicles of 60-90 nm diameter are too small for collagens some of which assemble in the ER into 300-400 nm rod-like structures. Collagen secretion appears to involve a modification of the COPII process involving TANGO1 and cTAGE5 which form a dimer at ER exit sites (Malhotra & Erlmann 2011). TANGO1-null mice die at birth and are defective in the secretion of a number of different collagens (Wilson et al. 2011). Another recent study suggests that ubiquitination of one of the COPII complex proteins, SEC31, is sufficient to allow formation of vesicles that are large enough to hold procollagen (Jin et al. 2012).",
