Trimers are exported from the ER and trafficked through the Golgi network before secretion into the extracellular space and organization into higher order structures. The precise route and mechanism of secretion for collagen is unclear (Canty & Kadler 2005). In the conventional protein secretion pathway cargo is collected at ER exits sites and loaded into small membrane vesicles that are generated by a set of highly conserved proteins called the coat protein complex II (COPII) (Jensen & Schekman 2011). However, these small vesicles of 60-90 nm diameter are too small for collagens some of which assemble in the ER into 300-400 nm rod-like structures. Collagen secretion appears to involve a modification of the COPII process involving TANGO1 and cTAGE5 which form a dimer at ER exit sites (Malhotra & Erlmann 2011). TANGO1-null mice die at birth and are defective in the secretion of a number of different collagens (Wilson et al. 2011). Another recent study suggests that ubiquitination of one of the COPII complex proteins, SEC31, is sufficient to allow formation of vesicles that are large enough to hold procollagen (Jin et al. 2012)."}, {"py/object": "gsd.gene_sets.GeneSetInfo", "calculated": false, "entrez_gene_ids": {"py/set": [91522, 136227, 1305, 84570, 1308]}, "external_id": "R-HSA-2152276", "external_source": "Reactome", "gene_symbols": {"py/set": ["COL13A1", "COL26A1", "COL25A1", "COL17A1", "COL23A1"]}, "name": "Secretion of transmembrane collagens", "summary": "Secretion of transmembrane collagens is presumably similar to the secretion of extracellular forms except that they are trafficked to the plasma membrane rather than the extracellular space."}, {"py/object": "gsd.gene_sets.GeneSetInfo", "calculated": false, "entrez_gene_ids": {"py/set": [131873, 1291, 1292, 256076, 1293]}, "external_id": "R-HSA-1614461", "external_source": "Reactome", "gene_symbols": {"py/set": ["COL6A5", "COL6A1", "COL6A3", "COL6A6", "COL6A2"]}, "name": "Tetramerization of procollagen VI", "summary": "Collagen VI dimers combine to form tetramers before secretion (Furthmayr et al. 1983, von der Mark et al. 1984, Engel et al. 1985, Engvall et al. 1986, Colombatti et al. 1987). Collagen type VI chains are extensively post translationally modifed by the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004) and subsequent glycosylation of hydroxylysine, thought to be essential for tetramer formation and secretion (Sipila et al. 2007)."}]
