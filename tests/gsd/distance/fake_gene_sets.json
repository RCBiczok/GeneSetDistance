The extent of 5-Hyl formation is much more variable than that of hydroxyproline. It varies between collagen types, tissues and by physiological state (Miller 1984). 5-Hyl content also differs between the helical and telopeptide domains. This and the observation that purified lysyl hydroxylase failed to hydroxylate Lys in the telopeptide domains has led to speculation that there are separate enzymes responsible for Lys hydroxylation in the helical and telopeptide domains (Royce & Barnes 1985, Gerriets et al. 1993). The LH2b isoform may be the telopeptide-specific form (Pornprasertsuk et al. 2004).<br>In human type I collagen, there are 38 residues of Lys in each alpha-1 chain (36 in the helical domain, 1 each in the C- and N-telopeptide domains) and 31 in each alpha-2 chain (30 in the helical domain,1 in the N-telopeptide and none in the C-telopeptide domains) (Yamauchi & Shiiba 2002).  <br><br>LH requires ferrous iron, oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate. The hydroxylation reaction occurs during collagen biosynthesis in the ER as a co- and post-translational event, before triple helix formation. Three LH isoforms have been characterized in humans, encoded by the genes PLOD1-3. The isoforms appear to have preferences for certain collagen types, e.g. LH3 preferentially binds collagen types IV, VI, XI and XII (Myllyla et al. 2007). LH3 has galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase activities in addition to its lysyl hydroxylase activity (Heikkinen et al. 2000, Wang et al. 2002), a multifunctionality also seen in the single C. elegans orthologue (Wang et al. 2002a, b).

This occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Engel & Prockop 1991). Compared with the folding of globular proteins and coiled-coil structures, the concentration-independent folding steps of collagen are extremely slow (B\u00e4chinger et al. 1980). Triple helix formation combines a fast process, interpreted as the folding of regions devoid of cis residues, and a slow process, limited by the slow kinetics of cis to trans prolyl-isomerization (B\u00e4chinger et al. 1978). Triple-helix formation in regions devoid of cis-prolyl bonds is 3-4 times faster than formation limited by prolyl isomerization reactions  (Bachmann et al. 2005). Conversion to trans is required as only trans-peptide bonds can be incorporated into the collagen triple helix (Zeng et al. 1998). Efficient helix folding requires the presence of the 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex. This trimer of Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (LEPRE1), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), also called Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) and CRTAP has 3-prolyl hydroxylase, PPIase and procollagen chaperone properties (Ishikawa et al. 2009, van Dijk et al. 2009). Efficient folding involves additional collagen-specific chaperones such as Serpin H1 (HSP47 - Smith et al. 1995). CyPB belongs to the cyclophilins, a conserved class of intracellular and/or secreted proteins originally identified as cellular binding proteins for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. They are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis-trans isomerisation of peptide bonds. CyPB localises to the rough ER but is also secreted extracellularly. It directly interacts with procollagen and is believed to  be responsible for converting procollagen cis- to trans-conformers (Zeng et al. 1998). CyPB and Serpin H1 are also involved in procollagen export and secretion. Results obtained with collagen peptides suggest that variations in the Gly-X-Y sequence are likely to result in a non-uniform helical twist along the length of a collagen fibril. Sequences poor in imino acids will have a symmetry close to 10 tripeptide units for every 3 turns of the triple helix (10/3), while stretches of Gly-Pro-Hyp units may have 7/2 symmetry (Brodsky & Persikov 2005)."}, "go_info": {"py/object": "gsd.annotation.GOInfo", "biological_process": {"py/object": "gsd.annotation.GOCategory", "definitions": {"py/set": ["The chemical reactions and pathways involving carbohydrates, any of a group of organic compounds based of the general formula Cx(H2O)y.

Though it is now known that other proteins such as C1q and elastin also contain 4-Hyp, collagen is by far the major source (Adams & Frank 1980). 4-Hyp is required for collagen stability at physiological temperatures. The abundance of Hyp in animal proteins is ~4%, making it more abundant than the amino-acids Cys, Gln, His, Met, Phe, Trp and Tyr (McCaldon & Argos 1988). In collagen Hyp abundance is much higher at ~38% (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Full collagen proline hydroxylation significantly raises the melting temperature (Tm) by stabilizing the collagen triple helix (Berg & Prockop 1973a), a process that has been studied extensively using synthetic collagen peptides (Sakakibara et al. 1973,  Holmgren et al. 1998) and is well understood at the structural level (Shoulders & Raines 2009). Collagen 4-Hyp content is relatively stable, with small differences between collagen types. Collagen type I has approximately 1 4-Hyp for every 10 residues, roughly 50% of available prolines (Kivirikko et al. 1992). Conversion of Pro to (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is the most prevalent posttranslational modification in humans, catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H).  Mammalian prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an alpha2 beta2 tetramer (Berg & Prockop 1973b). The 59-kDa alpha subunit contains the substrate-binding domain and the enzymic active site (Helaakoski et al. 1989). Humans and most other vertebrates have three isoforms of the alpha subunit, isoform alpha-1 is the most prevalent. The pair of alpha subunits can be any of the three isoforms (Gorres & Raines 2010). The 55-kDa beta subunit is protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which has additional functions in collagen formation. As part of P4H it retains the tetramer in the ER lumen and maintains the otherwise insoluble alpha subunit in an active form (Vuori et al. 1992, Nietfeld & Kemp 1981). P4H is a member of the non-heme iron(II), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Molecular oxygen (O2), 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and iron(II) are required for its activity (Hutton & Udenfriend 1966). During the reaction, alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated producing succinate and CO2 (Rhoads & Udenfriend 1968, Gorres & Raines 2010). Ascorbate is required as a cofactor but not consumed (Kivirikko et al 1989). The minimum substrate required for hydroxylation is an Xaa-Pro-Gly tripeptide, with Pro preferred in the Xaa position, though hydroxylation can occur at lower rates with a variety of residues at this position (Kivirikko et al. 1972). A number of other peptides, notably elastin, are substrates for P4H (Bhatnagar 1978).<br><br>For brevity, all forms of collagen propeptide are shown as having 3X 4-Hyp residues following the action of P4H."}, "go_info": {"py/object": "gsd.annotation.GOInfo", "biological_process": {"py/object": "gsd.annotation.GOCategory", "definitions": {"py/set": ["Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a sucrose stimulus.
